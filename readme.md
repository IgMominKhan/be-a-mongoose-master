# Be A Mongoose Master

## What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. This means
that data is stored in documents, which are similar to JSON objects(BSON).
MongoDB is a popular choice for modern applications because it is scalable,
flexible, and easy to use.

## Why MongoDB?

A list of reasons why you should use MongoDB:

- **Scalability:** MongoDB is designed to be scalable, meaning that it can
  handle large amounts of data.
- **Flexibility:** MongoDB is flexible, meaning that it can be used for a
  variety of applications.
- **Ease of use:** MongoDB is easy to use, meaning that it is simple to set up
  and manage.
- **Security:** MongoDB is secure, meaning that it is designed to protect your
  data.
- **Performance:** MongoDB is fast, meaning that it can handle large amounts of
  data.
- **Versatility:** MongoDB is versatile, meaning that it can be used for a
  variety of applications.
- **Reliability:** MongoDB is reliable, meaning that it is designed to be
  reliable.
- **Compatibility:** MongoDB is compatible, meaning that it can be used with
  other applications.
- **Cost-effective:** MongoDB is cost-effective, meaning that it is a good value
  for money.
- **Documentation:** MongoDB has a good documentation, meaning that you can
  learn how to use it.
- **Community:** MongoDB has a strong community, meaning that you can get help
  from other users.

## What is Mongoose?

Mongoose is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for MongoDB. It allows us to work
with MongoDB using Javascript object, rather than having to write raw MongoDB
queries. This can make it much easier to develop and maintain MongoDB
applications.

## Why Mongoose?

Mongoose provides a number of features that make it a powerful tool for working
with MongoDB, including:

- **Schema validation:** Mongoose allow us to define schemas for our documents.
  This ensures that the data in our documents is always in the correct format.

- **Query building:** Mongoose provides a number of methods for building queries
  against MongoDB collections. This makes it easy to find the data based on our
  needs.

- **Hooks:** Mongoose provides hooks that we can use to execute code before and
  after certain operations, such as saving, updating, and deleting documents.
  This allows us to customize the behavior of our MongoDB applications.

- **Middlewares:** Mongoose provides middlewares that we can use to intercept
  and modify queries before they are sent to MongoDB. This allow us to add
  additional functionality to our MongoDB applications.

- **Persistence:** Mongoose provides a number of methods for persisting
  documents in MongoDB. This allows us to store our data in a more efficient
  way.

- **Performance:** Mongoose provides a number of methods for optimizing
  performance. This allows us to improve the performance of our MongoDB
  applications.

  ## MongoDB Installation

  MongoDB Installation process varies based on your operating system. Please see
  the [MongoDB documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
  to instal MongoDB on your local machine.

  ## Mongoose Installation.

  ```ts
  npm i mongoose
  ```
